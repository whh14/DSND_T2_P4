# DSND_T2_P4
Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Term 2 Project 4

### Project summary
This goal of this project is to use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and other machine vision algoirthm to build a pipeline to process real world images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canine’s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the algorithm will identify the resembling dog breed.

### File Descriptions
dog_app.ipynb: jupyter notebook file consist of step by step demostration of building of the dog breed classifier pipeline.

### Instructions for jupyter notebook 
To run the jupyter notebook file, install all the necessary packages and run the jupyter notebook from a conda environment  

### Acknowledgements
I would like to thank Udacity for setting up the project.
